# Advance concepts, Training and learning rates

In this session, we learned
* Added cutout to images through albumentation.
* to find optimum learning rate of model through LR curve.

* Implemented ReduceLROnPlateau.
* Ran the model for 50 epoch.
* Used SDG with momentum
* Target Accuracy : 88 %, Highest test accuracy we acheived : 89.79 %
