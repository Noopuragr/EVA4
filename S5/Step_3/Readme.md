Target: 
1. To reduce overfitting.
2. Reduce gap between train and test accuracy

Changes Made : Added Batch normalization and dropout 

Result :

1. Total params: 9,588
2. Train Accuracy : 99.24
3. Test Accuracy : 99.24

Analysis : 
1. Good Model
2. No overfitting, model is capable if pushed further
3. Still need to improve accuracy
