**Architectural Basics (MNIST Classification)**

Reaching 99.4% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset with a model having less than 20,000 parameters and has been trained for less than 20 epochs. To see the code go [here](https://github.com/Noopuragr/EVA4/tree/master/S4).

**Parameter Optimization**

Reaching 99.4% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset with a model having less than 10,000 parameters and has been trained for less than 15 epochs. To see the code go [here](https://github.com/Noopuragr/EVA4/tree/master/S5)

**Regularization**
Applying L1 and L2 regularization on the final model trained in Session 5. To see the code go[here](https://github.com/Noopuragr/EVA4/tree/master/S6).
